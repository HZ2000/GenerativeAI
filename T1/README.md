### Application Description

    This is a simple application that allow users to view a list
    of available products, add new products, and update existing ones 
    from MySQL database. Each product has a name, description, price, 
    and quantity.The application is written in Java and uses Spring Boot 
    framework.

### How to run the application
    
    In order to run the appliaction you need to setup your local MySQL
    database. You can either stick to the admin user that you intially
    have or create a new one and grant user the necessary permissions. 
    Then you need to create a database called inventory. After which you
    should change the data written in application.properties file to match
    your user data. After that you'll be able to run the application using 
    the default run configuration in IntelliJ IDEA.

# Q/A

### Q1: Was it easy to complete the task using AI?Â 

    The task was very easy to complete, especially with an AI, 
    since It was helping with the code structure. It came handy 
    when I was writing tests as well.

### Q2: How long did task take you to complete? 

    It took me about 2 hours to complete the task, given the fact
    that most of the issues came from setting up the local database.

### Q3: Was the code ready to run after generation? 

    Most of the logic that ChatGPT generated needed additional 
    direction from me, but It was easy to navigate through the 
    process. The test codes were mostly ready to run after generation.

### Q4: Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?

    The main challenge was setting up the local database, since for
    some reason I couldn't connect to the database, but I eventually
    figured It out.

### Q5: Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?

    Mentioning the entity names and giving the AI a direction was 
    really helpful. Before that It was creating random properties
    for the objects and It wasn't the case when I specifically 
    mentioned the entity names and gave it the code snippet.

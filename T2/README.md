### Application Description

    This is an application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on books,
    authors, and genres. Books have a title, author, genre, price, and 
    quantity. Users are also able to search for books by title, author,
    or genre.The application is written in Java and uses Spring Boot framework.

### How to run the application

    In order to run the appliaction you need to setup your local MySQL
    database. You can either stick to the admin user that you intially
    have or create a new one and grant user the necessary permissions. 
    Then you need to create a database called inventory. After which you
    should change the data written in application.properties file to match
    your user data. After that you'll be able to run the application using 
    the default run configuration in IntelliJ IDEA.

# Q/A

### Q1: Was it easy to complete the task using AI?Â 

    The task was easy to complete using AI, since It had a pre-concieved
    idea of what I wanted to do. I just had to give it a directions and 
    It returned the necessary code chunks.

### Q2: How long did task take you to complete?

    It took me about 4 hours to complete the task.

### Q3: Was the code ready to run after generation?

    Most of the logic that ChatGPT generated needed additional 
    direction from me, but It was easy to navigate through the 
    process. The test codes were mostly ready to run after generation.

### Q4: Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?

    The main challenge was the multimple entities and their database
    connections, but I was able to figure out that quite quickly.

### Q5: Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?

    I gave ChatGPT the controller that I needed the tests for. It generated the code 
    with a couple of mistakes, I fixed them and the the next time I wanted to generate tests
    for other controllers, I would give it the right example of tests I wanted It to analize,
    and It did the task for other controllers correctly.
